# Password Manager

Password Manager is a project that securely stores and manages passwords using RSA encryption implemented through the OpenSSL library. **While the project is still under development, the basic functionality is already in place. The program generates RSA keys, stores and retrieves them from files and encrypts and decrypts stored passwords using RSA encryption algorithm.**

In addition to RSA encryption, the Password Manager project is also working on adding an extra layer of SHA256 encryption to further enhance the security of the stored passwords. This document provides an overview of the project, its features, and its usage.
